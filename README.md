This repository contains four Python-based mini-projects showcasing applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Data Validation.

##  1. Named Entity Recognition (NER)

**Goal:** Identify and classify entities like people, organizations, locations in a sentence using spaCy.

### Features:

* Uses `spaCy` and the `en_core_web_sm` model.
* Interactive console input for dynamic entity detection.



##  2. Text Summarization

**Goal:** Automatically summarize large text content such as articles or research papers.

### Features:

* Uses `sumy`, `gensim`, or `transformers` for extractive/abstractive summarization.
* Input: long-form text
* Output: concise summary.



##  3. Interactive Medical Assistant

**Goal:** Chatbot-style assistant for providing health-related information or answering medical questions.

### Features:

* Uses NLP to understand and respond to user queries.
* Can be extended with external knowledge bases (e.g., Medline, PubMed, etc.).



## 4. Data Pipeline Validator

**Goal:** Validate data at different stages of a processing pipeline using `Pydantic`.

### Features:

* Uses Pydantic models to enforce schema and data type constraints.
* Helps catch data quality issues early in ETL or ML pipelines.
